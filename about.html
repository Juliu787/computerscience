            <p class="custom-text">Computer science is the foundation of the information technology era that we are living in. Therefore, if humanity is to achieve quick economic advancements and fully benefit from information technology, computer science education is essential. The study and creation of programs that enable us to use computers on a daily basis, the software systems that underpin these applications, and the techniques and procedures employed to create applications and systems that function dependably, accurately, and morally are all included in computer science. The ability to program computers is at the core of computer science, and companies hiring computer scientists look for skilled programmers who understand current methods and tools and can apply good engineering principles to the creation, building, and upkeep of computer programs.</p>
            <p class="custom-text">Our graduates are prepared for the computing industry by the variety of courses offered in the department and the skills they acquire. These courses enable students to work in a project team, research and development team, or other setting where they can contribute specialized skills. Additionally, by exposing students to current computer science research topics and both existing and new technologies and methodologies, the course offers a platform for additional study or research.</p>
            <p class="custom-text">The Department of Computer Science offers two undergraduate degree programs: the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1).</p>
